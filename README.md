# 7_AI_model_stages_from_Scratch
7 stages to create your own AI model to solve any kind of problems: Regression, classification, and anomanly detection

### project 1: Data Manipulation and Visulaization 
Perform basic data manipulation: filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregating. Create visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to understand data distributions and relationships.

### project 2: Data Preprocessing
Handle missing values using various techniques (mean/mode imputation, forward fill, etc.). Encode categorical variables (one-hot encoding, label encoding). Normalize/standardize numerical features. Identify and remove outliers if necessary

### project 3: Exploratory Data Analysis
Calculate and interpret summary statistics. Create visualizations to explore relationships between variables (scatter plots, box plots, histograms, heatmaps).Identify and analyze key patterns and insights from the data.

### project 4: Supervised Learning (Regression)
Train a linear regression model and evaluate its performance using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2. Experiment with other regression algorithms (Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree Regressor). Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.

### project 5: Supervised Learning (Classification)
Train a logistic regression model and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Experiment with other classification algorithms (Random Forest, SVM, KNN). Perform hyperparameter tuning to improve model performance.


### project 6: Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)
Preprocess the dataset (normalize features if necessary). Implement K-means clustering and determine the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method. Visualize clusters and interpret the results. Experiment with hierarchical clustering and compare results.

### project 7: Deep Learning (Neural Network)
Preprocess the dataset (normalize pixel values, one-hot encode labels). Build a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras. Train the network and evaluate its performance on the test set. Experiment with different network architectures and hyperparameters.
